	act	of	the	united	states	and	oth- er	relevant	 laws	and	regulations,	 vnet	consistently	 improves	 the modern	 corporate	 governance	 structure,	 actively	 creates	a	positive internal	 and	external	 governance	 environment,	 protects	 the	interests of	all	shareholders,	 and	promotes	 the	healthy	 and	stable	develop - ment	of	the	group.	the	robust	governance	 structure	 is	comprised of	the	general	 meeting	 of	shareholders,	 the	board	of	directors	 and its	subordinate	 committees,	 as	well	as	the	management.	 under	the supervision	 and	guidance	 of	these	board	committees,	 the	board	of directors	 provides	 consultation	 and	suggestions	 on	the	management of	various	divisions.	 this	involves	 formulating	 relevant	 strategies,	 su- pervising	 their	implementation,	 and	monitoring	 the	operational	 and financial	 performance	 of	the	group,	ensuring	 soundness	 of	internal control	and	risk	management	 systems.	 our	board	committees'	 scope of	responsibilities	 is	published	 on	the	official	website	of	vnet	and	is available	to	all	shareholders.	responsible governance governance structure we	believe	that	board	diversity	 brings	different	 perspectives	 for	the development	 of	the	group	and	provides	 a	solid	foundation	 for	pro- moting	sustainability.	 in	accordance	 with	committee	 charters,	 the corporate	 governance	 and	nomination	 committee	 evaluates	 the board	structure	 every	year	in	terms	of	independence,	 expertise,	 skill and	experience	 of	board	members.	 it	is	devoted	 to	selecting	 the	most qualified	 members	 according	 to	the	principle	 of	diversity.	 the	factors to	be	considered	 include	but	are	not	limited	to	gender,	cultural	 back- ground	and	race.	this	is	to	ensure	the	balance	 between	 skill,	experi- ence	and	view	diversity	and	improve	the	board	effectiveness. as	of	the	end	of	the	reporting	period,	the	board	of	directors	consisted of	six	members,	 including	 one	executive	 director	 and	five	indepen- dent	non-executive 	directors. 	the	current	directors 	of	the	group	are all	equipped	 with	professional	 qualities	 and	strong	educational	 back-

key	to	the	success	 of	the	group.	in	accor- dance	with	the	nasdaq's	 corporate	 gov- ernance 	guidelines 	and	other	guidelines, we	develop	 risk	management	 and	internal control	 systems	 tailored	 to	the	character - istics	of	our	business	 development.	 we identify	 and	give	early	warnings	 to	financial and	non-financial	 risks	in	the	operation	 pro- cess,	as	well	as	put	in	place	an	effective	 risk prevention	 and	control	mechanism.	 we	also clearly	define	the	roles	and	responsibilities assumed	 by	the	board	of	directors,	 board	of supervisors, 	management,	 internal 	control teams	and	external	 audit	agencies	 in	the	risk prevention	 and	control	 system	 to	ensure both	soundness	and	effectiveness.risk prevention and control risks	such	as	climate

for risk management based	on	the	coso	internal	 control-integrated	 framework	 issued by	the	committee	 of	sponsoring	 organizations	 of	the	treadway commission 	(coso)	and	in	accordance 	with	the	sarbanes-oxley act,	vnet	adopts	the	three	lines	of	defense	 model	for	risk	manage - ment.	the	model	distinguishes	 the	level	and	role	of	different	 lines of	defense	 involved	 in	risk	management	 and	defines	 the	control process	 for	risks	of	various	 types.	the	first	line	of	defense	 focuses on	the	prevention	 and	control	 of	business-related	 risks	through regular	 business	 processes.	 the	second	 line	of	defense	 manages risk-related	 tasks	and	activities	 from	the	perspective	 of	functional departments.	 it	guides	and	oversees	 the	first	line	of	defense	 to	op- timize	risk	management.	 the	third	line	of	defense	 provides	 post- event	examination	 and	assessment	 of	the	operation	 of	the	first	and second	lines	of	defense	 by	the	internal	 control	department.	 in	doing this,	we	identify	problems	 and	arrange	 for	rectifications	 to	ensure	the implementation	 and	optimization	 of	risk	management	 policies	 and responsibilities. forward-looking risk management vnet	pays	particular	 attention	 to	risks	that	are	highly	sensitive	 to corporate	 operations,	 such	as	the	risk	of	relevant	 transactions.	 we are	committed

highest	ethical	standards. 	we	formulated 	and	issued	the	code	of business	 conduct	 and	ethical	standards,	 requiring	 employees	 of the	group	and	third-party	 agencies	 to	engage	in	business	 activities accordingly. as	a	corporate	 member	 of	united	nations	 global	compact	 (ungc), vnet	has	always	unswervingly	 protected	 internationally	 recog- nized	human	rights.	we	oppose	any	disregard

are	designed	 in	accordance	 with	the one-star	 green	building	 standard.	 for	architectural	 design,	we	adopt more	energy-saving	 and	environment-friendly	 building	 structures or	designs.	 for	the	selection	 of	building	 materials,	 we	give	priority to	materials	 that	are	durable,	 environment	 friendly	 and	recyclable. in	addition,	 we	plan	to	apply	for	green	building	 certification	 such	as leed	or	green	building	for	all	newly-planned	data	centers. high-efficiency equipment the	energy	consumption 	of	data	centers	mainly	comes	from	it equipment,	 cooling	system,

zero-carbon future contributing to sustainability: towards a zero-carbon future major physical risks relevant to the group under the ssp path: heat dissipation efficiency is crucial to the stable operation of a data center. hot weather will impose higher requirements on the heat dissipation performance of servers and other electronic equipment. moreover, hot weather may affect the normal work of employees. high temperature since the cooling of data center equipment requires a large amount of water, some areas with high stress on water resources may face the risk of water shortage.water stress an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events may cause damage to data centers, office buildings and equipment, resulting in operational interruption and accelerated equipment depreciation. service interruptions or major damage to equipment may also directly or indirectly affect customers' business continuity and economic interests. in addition, severe extreme weather events may also pose threats to the lives of employees. frequency and severity of extreme weather events in the long run, rising sea levels may affect the layout of data centers operating in coastal areas and force their relocation to inland regions. sea-level rise major transitional risks relevant to the group under the ssp path: china's national and local governments may launch more stringent climate policies (such as implementing a carbon price mechanism and urge the use of renewable energy), which will therefore have impact on the management of energy use and carbon emissions at vnet's data centers.policy and legal the emergence of new technologies (such as renewable energy, energy storage, and energy efficiency) will require vnet to keep abreast of the development of the latest technologies to improve our energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. technology shareholders, customers, news media and other stakeholders are highly interested in vnet's efforts to reduce energy and carbon emissions and address climate change. therefore, we need to take positive actions to meet the expectations of the stakeholders under this issue. reputational shifts in customer preferences may increase the focus on low-carbon data centers and renewable energy and such shifts may produce an impact on the marketing of our core business. market climate risk analysis and countermeasures climate scenario analysis to gain a better understanding of the potential impact of climate change on vnet's business, the group, based on the assumptions of the shared socioeconomic pathways (ssps) adopted by the ipcc combined with the external environment of the group's operations (such as natural ecology and socioeconomic environment). the approach identified multi-dimensional influencing factors including temperature, extreme weather, climate policy and renewable energy demand and selected the sustainability pathway (ssp) and fossil-fueled development pathway (ssp) to carry out qualitative preliminary climate scenario analysis. ssp represents a sustainability-focused low-emission scenario, in which global macro and climate-related policies are tightened and the society-wide low-carbon transition may expose companies to more potential policy restrictions, which in effect impact their operations and revenues. therefore, vnet will face more challenges from transitional risks in this scenario. ssp represents a high-emission scenario, in which economic growth and technological advancement are driven by fossil fuels. greenhouse gas emissions will remain at a high level before the year , which may exacerbate the occurrence of extreme weather events. therefore, we identified and analyzed vnet's acute and chronic physical risks and countermeasures in this scenario. based on the nature of the group's business and the geographical location of our operations, we identified the physical risks under the ssp path and the transitional risks under the ssp path. we considered the possibility and extent of the impact of relevant risks on the group's operations to determine the relevance of each climate issue to vnet's business operations. contributing to sustainability: towards a zero-carbon future acute physical risk- significant increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather eventsat the company level, worldwide extreme weather events caused by climate change, such as extreme rainfall, typhoons, and floods, may threaten the physical security, stable power supply, and short-term electricity cost of our data centers and the it infrastructure of our customers. moreover, the growing frequency and intensity of regional extreme weather events further increases the possibility and impact of acute risks.short-term long-term to mitigate the impact of such risk, we consider the risk exposures of extreme weather events at different stages of the asset life cycle. we first manage potential risks through scientific site selection and design standards for data centers, and then take preventive measures to reduce losses associated with acute weather events. we evaluate and check the effectiveness of these measures annually and ensure that effective management measures are in place for climate change risk factors in each data center. meanwhile, vnet receives reports from insurance service providers, and purchases insurance for each item of asset accordingly. high temperature on the one hand, hot weather may shorten the working hours of the group's employees in the open air and place higher requirements for heatstroke prevention and cooling. on the other hand, hot weather may increase the difficulty in cooling equipment at data centers. an increase in temperature may raise the possibility of fires, potentially exposing us to the risk of operational interruption or asset loss. long-termwe are always concerned about the occupational health and safety of our employees and provide a series of protective measures and subsidies for outdoor operations of employees in hot weather. we apply greater prudence in the planning and siting phase, considering the potential physical risks of building data centers in areas with prolonged hot weather to avoid relevant risks or to take early countermeasures. we optimize cooling systems during the design phase and continuously improve cooling efficiency through various technology upgrades during the operational phase. water stress water resource shortage may translate into stress on equipment cooling in data centers, affecting their operational stability. severe droughts may lead to more expensive water bills and higher operating costs. long-term we identify and assess the water resources stress where our data centers are located, and consider it in data center planning and siting. meanwhile, we actively develop water-free cooling technologies, take various measures to improve water use efficiency and continuously reduce dependence on water resources. sea-level rise in the long run, rising sea levels may flood data centers in coastal areas, resulting in loss of assets and revenue.long-term we consider the potential physical risks of building data centers in coastal areas and constantly optimize the layout of data centers. policy and legal as policies and legal requirements such as carbon emission-related laws, regulations, policies and taxes and mandatory carbon trading come into effect, compliance costs may rise.short-term long-term to reduce this risk, we strengthen energy management and control as well as gradually raising the proportion of clean energy. we have a dedicated team that regularly studies national policies and proposes countermeasures to ensure our operational compliance. contributing to sustainability: towards a zero-carbon future opportunity management the low-carbon development of data centers will be an important driving force to promote the

	with	the	sarbanes-oxley act,	vnet	adopts	the	three	lines	of	defense	 model	for	risk	manage - ment.	the	model	distinguishes	 the	level	and	role	of	different	 lines of	defense	 involved	 in	risk	management	 and	defines	 the	control process	 for	risks	of	various	 types.	the	first	line	of	defense	 focuses on	the	prevention	 and	control	 of	business-related	 risks	through regular	 business	 processes.	 the	second	 line	of	defense	 manages risk-related	 tasks	and	activities	 from	the	perspective	 of	functional departments.	 it	guides	and	oversees	 the	first	line	of	defense	 to	op- timize	risk	management.	 the	third	line	of	defense	 provides	 post- event	examination	 and	assessment	 of	the	operation	 of	the	first	and second	lines	of	defense	 by	the	internal	 control	department.	 in	doing this,	we	identify	problems	 and	arrange	 for	rectifications	 to	ensure	the implementation	 and	optimization	 of	risk	management	 policies	 and responsibilities.

highest	ethical	standards. 	we	formulated 	and	issued	the	code	of business	 conduct	 and	ethical	standards,	 requiring	 employees	 of the	group	and	third-party	 agencies	 to	engage	in	business	 activities accordingly. as	a	corporate	 member	 of	united	nations	 global	compact	 (ungc), vnet	has	always	unswervingly	 protected	 internationally	 recog- nized	human	rights.	we	oppose	any	disregard	 or	violation	 of	human rights,	and	never	tolerate	 any	unlawful	 discrimination	 or	harassment against	race,	ethnicity,	 region,	gender,	 age,	nationality	 or	class,	etc. we	incorporate 	personal	 privacy	 protection, 	employee	 rights	pro- tection,	and	supply	chain	human	rights	protection 	into	our	business activities	 and	proactively	 promote	 the	implementation	 of	related work.	we	also	respect	the	right	of	existence	 and	development	 for	the poor,	the	disabled	 and	other	special	groups,	and	lend	support	 to	the development	of	human	rights	in	disadvantaged	and	remote	areas.business ethics business continuity management system and information security management system certificationscompliance management

compliance	 and	information	 security	 management	 and	other	sys- tems,	which	specify	issues	such	as	anti-corruption,	 anti-monopoly, intellectual	 property	 and	confidentiality.	 we	also	form	a	three-tier compliance	management	system: ●	the	compliance	 and	information	 security	 management	 commit- tee	formulates	 the	overall	policies	 and	objectives	 related	to	com- pliance	management ●	the	compliance	 and	information	 security	 working	 group	ensures daily	business	compliance ●	relevant	 departments	 are	responsible	 for	risk	identification	 and

management	 system	 (iso	) certifications. in	accordance	 with	the	laws	and	regulations	 related	to	intellectual property,	 such	as	the	patent	law	of	the	people's	 republic	 of	chi- na,	the	trademark	 law	of	the	people's	 republic	 of	china,	and	the copyright	 law	of	the	people's	 republic	 of	china,	the	group	has established	 a	robust	intellectual	 property	 management	 system	and specified	 the	organizational	 structure	 of	intellectual	 property	 man- agement	 and	the	responsibilities	 of	all	departments	 involved.	 in ,	the	group	enhanced	 management	 in	aspects	 such	as	patent,

property	 system.	 in case	of	infringement	 of	intellectual	 property	 rights,	we	will	activate an	emergency	 feedback	 mechanism	 and	set	up	special	teams	to	col-lect	and	analyze	 the	evidence.	 we	will	also	issue	a	warning	 letter	in time	to	safeguard	 our	legitimate	 rights	and	interests.	 thanks	to	our excellent	 intellectual	 property	 management,	 we	won	the	honor	of ""beijing	intellectual	property	demonstration	unit""	in	. to	avoid	infringement	 of	the	intellectual	 property	 rights	of	third	par- ties,	we	meticulously	 review	the	terms	of	intellectual	 property	 rights in	the	contract	 and	agree	on	the	ownership	 of	intellectual	 property rights	to	avoid	disputes.	 we	also	keep	track	of	patent	application within	the	industry	 and	identify	 infringement	 in	advance.	 if	any	vi- olation	is	identified,	 we	will	promptly	 notify	relevant	 departments of	rectification	 before	deadline.	 in	,	vnet	was	not	involved	 in

the	business	 ethics	of	com- pliance,	veracity	and	integrity. anti-corruption vnet	adopts	zero-tolerance	 policies	 towards	 corruption.	 adhering	 to the	handling	 principles	 of	education,	 supervision,	 punishment,	 and protection,	 we	establish	 a	complete	 integrity	 management	 system and	formulate	 various	policies,	 such	as	the	gift	registration	 system, the	integrity	 inspection	 system,	 the	integrity	 conservation	 system, the	integrity	 and	whistleblowing	 rewards	 program,	 and	the	whis- tleblowing	 and	whistleblower	 protection	 policy.	in	addition	 to	speci- fying	the	anti-corruption	 system,	 supervision	 management,	 integrity education,	 whistleblowing,	 and	investigation,	 we	also	require	 all employees	 and	third-party	 suppliers	 to	sign	the	anti-bribery	 commit- ment	letter,	and	implement	 an	effective	 whole-process	 anti-corrup - tion	mechanism,	 so	as	to	ensure	the	healthy,	 stable	and	long-term development	of	the	group. risk prevention vnet	establishes	 an	anti-corruption	 risk	identification	 management process,	 conducts	 regular	bi-annual	 inspections	 to	identify	 and	urge relevant	 departments	 to	resolve	risks	in	a	timely	manner.	 based	on the	risk	identification	 and	evaluation	 system	model,	we	identify	 po- tential	integrity	 risks	and	management	 loopholes	 within	the	group in	the	daily	work.	after	confirming	 the	existence	 of	risks,	the	integrity department	 and	the	audit	department	 will	jointly	conduct	 investiga- tions,	and	carry	out	quantitative	 analysis	 of	integrity	 risks.	according to	the	complaints	 and	feedback	 from	external	 channels,	 we	also	in- vestigate	 post	responsibilities	 and	corruption	 risks,	identify	 the	risks
