We	believe	in	long-term	commitments	and	responsibilities	for	our	

industry,	environment,	and	society,	as	they	are	the	foundation	of	our	

ongoing	success	in	a	highly	competitive,	ever-changing	market.	To

Towards zero carbon: VNET	has	developed	the	""4C""	strategy	for	our	

2030	carbon	neutrality	commitment	and	continued	to	make	progress	

toward	this	target	by	the	following	initiatives:	explore	and	expand	op-

To achieve net zero set out in the Paris Agreement, China announced the goals of ""striving to peak carbon diox-

ide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060"" in September 2020. In line with China's 

""dual carbon"" goals and the Group strategy of sustainability, VNET has taken the initiative to make the applica-

tion of clean technologies one of its core strategies and develop carbon neutrality strategies. We also support 

our customers and partners with cloud services to reduce energy consumption in IT infrastructure, to jointly 

build a zero-carbon society. 

Commitments to Carbon Neutrality

Our Targets

Faced	with	the	global	challenges	of	climate	change,	VNET,	as	a	lead-

ing	and	responsible	IT	infrastructure	service	provider,	has	set	ambi-

tious	carbon	reduction	targets.	These	are	based	on	the	results	of	car-

with	our	past	carbon	reduction	practices,	in	an	attempt	to	drive	the	

Group's	low-carbon	transition.	Our	carbon	reduction	commitments	

are	as	follows:

By	2030

Achieving	operational	carbon neutrality	

in	Scope	1	and	Scope	2	emissions

Achieving	100%	renewable	energy	use	in	operations

Based	on	our	current	carbon	emission	status	and	business	model,	we	have	developed	a	""4C""	pathway	towards	carbon	neutrality,	namely,	carbon	

avoidance,	carbon	reduction,	carbon	offset,	and	carbon	empowerment.	This	will	fully	leverage	an	array	of	approaches	including	renewable	ener-

gy	transition,	energy-saving	technology	use,	carbon	sinks,	carbon	trading	and	empowerment	of	the	upstream	and	downstream	industrial	chain.

Carbon Reduction

	● 	Achieve	100%	renewable	energy	use	by	2030	
through	direct	purchase	of	green	power,	pur-

and	investment	in	clean	energy	sources.

Climate Action: Towards a Zero-carbon FutureOur Actions

As	shown	by	VNET's	statistical	records	and	carbon	emission	inventory	results,	the	majority	of	carbon	emissions	from	our	operations	come	from	

electricity	use.	Therefore,	the	transition	to	renewable	energy	is	an	essential	pathway	to	reducing	greenhouse	gas	emissions	and	mitigating	cli-

mate	change.

Multi-dimensional renewable energy practices

Distributed	renewable	energy

In	some	of	our	data	centers,	we	have	either	installed	renewable	energy	generation	equipment	or	reserved	equipment	installation	locations,	such	

as	rooftop	PV	systems	for	office	or	park	lighting.	This	move	only	realizes	the	integrated	utilization	of	solar	energy	and	buildings	to	enhance	the	

percentage	of	green	power	use	in	data	centers,	but	also	lays	the	foundation	for	boosting	the	comprehensive	energy	utilization	in	the	park.

one-star	green	building	standard.	For	architectural	design,	we	adopt	

more	energy-saving	and	environment-friendly	building	structures	

or	designs.	For	the	selection	of	building	materials,	we	give	priority	

to	materials	that	are	durable,	environment	friendly	and	recyclable.	

In	addition,	we	plan	to	apply	for	green	building	certification	such	as	

LEED	or	GREEN	BUILDING	for	all	newly-planned	data	centers.

High-efficiency equipment

The	energy	consumption	of	data	centers	mainly	comes	from	IT

Certification for Information Security Management System 

In	2021,	VNET	continued	to	promote	the	certification	of	information	

security	management	systems.

Currently,	our	data	centers	are	certified	as	level	3	by	the	China	Cy-

Privacy and Data Security Protection

VNET	has	utilized	world-leading	encryption	methods,	protocols,	and	

algorithms	to	ensure	that	customer	data	is	securely	transmitted	and	

confidentially	stored	within	our	infrastructure.	We	have	applied	a	

variety	of	security	protection	technologies	and	methods	to	fully	se-

cure	the	customer	cloud	computing	environment.	While	discussing	

technology	types	with	our	customers	in	the	early	phase	of	a	project,	

we	delved	into	their	requirements	on	information	security	to	cus-

tomize	cloud	platform	solutions.	This	includes,	but	is	not	limited	to,	

the	selection	of	cloud	platforms	and	security	components	as	well	as	

suggestions	on	security	strategies	and	network	isolation.

In	addition,	VNET	formulated	the	Regulations	on	Access	Management	

Systems,	the	Office	Network	Security	Access	Management	Regula-

tions,	the	Remote	Access	Permission	Management	Regulations	and	

other	regulations	to	standardize	security	operations	by	employees	in	

different	working	environments.

Fostering Culture

VNET	is	fully	aware	that	the	implementation	of	information	security	

management	does	not	only	depend	on	the	continuous	improvement	

of	systems,	mechanisms,	and	technologies	but	also	relies	on	the	full	

engagement	of	employees.	We	highly	value	fostering	an	information	

security	culture	and	awareness	among	our	employees	and	offering	

targeted	training	covered	multiple	dimensions	such	as	information	

security	regulations,	concepts,	systems	and	technologies.	This	aims	

to	prepare	them	for	different	risks	in	different	positions	that	they	may	

face.	In	2021,	100%	of	our	employees	received	training	on	informa-

tion	security.

Formulating Industry Standard

As	an	industry	leader,	VNET	pursues	the	overall	improvement	of	in-

formation	security	in	the	entire	industry.	We	have	maintained	close	

ties	with	the	China	Electronics	Standardization	Institute	(CESI),	the	

National	Information	Security	Standardization	Technical	Committee,	

CAICT,	and	the	Cloud	Computing	Standards	and	Open-Source	Pro-

motion	Committee,	to	deeply	get	involved	in	formulating	relevant	

policies	and	standards.

partner	up	with	more	educational	institutions,	including	universities

During	 the	 event,	 our	 community	 of	 employees	 spent	 244	 hours

Caring for the Health of Mountain-area Girls

At	the	beginning	of	2022,	VNET	organized	a	charity	sale	themed	""Em-

Message from CEO 

The year 2022 was full of challenges. The turbulent international situation, intensified climate change and the sluggish 

Value co-creation 

global economy have all increased the complexity of the business environment and the uncertainty of business operations. 

VNET has demonstrated its corporate responsibility in an all-round way and regards long-term social responsibility as its 

However, looking back on the year, VNET, as a leading carrier- and cloud-neutral internet data center services provider in 

foundation. Adhering to the ""people-oriented"" employment philosophy, we respect and protect the rights of employees, 

China, faced the challenges head-on and forged ahead bravely. 

We have ridden the wave of the global digital economy, responded to the East-Data-West-Computing strategic deployment 

and the ""dual carbon"" target proposed by China. On the basis of providing a neutral digital base, we actively explore 

new technologies, new industries, new formats, and new models, helping to create a new era of networked, digital, and 

intelligent transformation. 

While developing our business, we have relied on the SHIELD sustainability system and deeply implemented the ESG 

concept. We have been able to promote the harmonious coexistence between the enterprise and the economy, society and 

environment with practical actions, writing a new chapter in the sustainable development of the global digital economy. 

Towards zero carbon 

VNET has been adhering to the green development path of high-efficiency, intensive, low-carbon circulation for data 

centers, responding to the national call to ""accelerate the construction of a new power system based on new energy"" and 

making unremitting efforts to build ""zero-carbon"" data centers. In early 2022, we developed the ""4C"" pathway towards 

carbon neutrality and fully leveraged an array of approaches including renewable energy transition, energy-saving

Risk Management
VNET firmly believes that the effective risk 

management and internal control hold the 

key to the success of the Group operation. 

In accordance with the NASDAQ's 

Corporate Governance Guidelines 

and other guidelines, we develop risk 

management and internal control systems 

tailored to the characteristics of our 

business development. We identify and 

give early warnings to financial and non-

financial risks in the operation process 

to form an effective risk prevention and 

control mechanism. We also clearly define 

the roles and responsibilities of the Board 

of Directors, management, internal control 

teams and external audit agencies in the 

risk prevention and control system to 

ensure both soundness and effectiveness.

data centers in West China, with the growth rate of data 

environmental protection, and carry out environmental 

center investment in West China twice than that in East 

impact assessments in accordance with the Law of the 

China for the next five years. 

In addition, due to the high dependence of data centers 

on water resources, we pay close attention to the water 

stress in our operation location. In the siting process, 

we evaluated the current and future local water stress, 

and compared them with historical water use data from 

nationwide data centers as reference for the siting of 

new data centers, in order to enhance the reliability and 

resilience of facility operations, while preparing for future 

aggravation in water stress.

Case: Green design of fluorine pump

One of VNET's data center in Guangzhou plans to apply the fluorine pump phase-change cooling technology 

to minimize the temperature difference between evaporation and condensation, significantly reducing the 

mechanical energy consumption of the cooling system. The high-efficiency variable frequency fluorine pump 

delivered refrigerant directly to the end, effectively reducing the delivery power consumption compared with 

conventional water-cooling systems. The high-efficiency heat exchange design enabled the data center to operate 

at a high evaporation temperature, thus reducing the requirement for the outdoor temperature and fully leveraging 

natural cooling sources. 

A data center of VNET in North China is equipped with a pilot test line for the integrated fully variable frequency 

fluorine pump to verify its performance in severe cold and waterless conditions. The equipment adopts an 

integrated design and requires no on-site joint commissioning or consumption of water which greatly leverages 

the green design of the data center.

Energy efficiency 

VNET is committed to promoting the efficient operation 
and maintenance of data centers and constantly explores 
operating modes or technologies that can improve energy 
efficiency and reduce carbon emissions to help achieve 
the zero-carbon target. We have formulated documents 
such as the Carbon Emissions Management System and 
the Energy Management System, aiming to guide energy 
saving and consumption reduction of the data centers, 
and continuously strengthen water management and 
improve water use and cooling efficiency. In 2022, we 
compiled guidelines on the energy-saving operation of 
data centers and conducted project statistics and analysis 
of the existing data centers nationwide to promote the 
energy-saving transformation of equipment. VNET's main 
business premises all passed the Energy Management 
System (ISO 50001) certification. 

VNET organically combines the application of energy-
saving technologies with intelligent management. The 
independently-developed Data Center Infrastructure 
Management (DCIM) platform system realizes the 
efficient operation and maintenance management of 
data centers through functions such as ""centralized 
intelligent monitoring"" and ""intelligent capacity"". At the 
same time, we continuously explore the application of 

AI technologies in data centers and, utilizing AI energy 
efficiency management technologies to output optimal 
control strategies and parameters through intelligent 
analysis and processing of operational data. This approach 
thereby reduces the overall energy consumption of 
cooling systems. In VNET's data centers, AI technologies 
are also used for fully automated system inspection and 
fault prediction to improve operation and maintenance 
efficiency. 

In response to the common problem of heat loss in 
data centers, we carry out waste heat recovery project 
to maximize the recycling of wasted heat. In 2022, we 
conducted in-depth research on waste heat recovery, 
surveyed the surrounding resources of data centers 
nationwide and carried out feasibility studies to promote 
the application of waste heat recovery in data centers. 
In addition, we cooperated with a third-party waste 
heat utilization company to investigate the waste heat 
utilization scheme of Boxing Data Center and improve the 
efficiency of heat utilization. In 2022, VNET Ulanqab Data 
Center explored the application of new air source heat 
recovery to realize the secondary utilization of heat and 
reduce the PUE of the data center. 

Case: Building Automation Energy-Saving Control System

Through the application of Building Automation Energy-Saving Control System, VNET realizes automatic control of cold 
source. The system utilizes AI technology to calculate the optimal operating frequency of the water pump according to the test 
data and automatically adjust the frequency. The cooling water main engine can also adjust the cooling water temperature 
appropriately according to the changes of environment and seasons, effectively improving the energy efficiency. 

This year, VNET continued to promote the research and development of the Dual Carbon Management and Energy Efficiency 
Monitoring Platform, in order to achieve accurate and effective carbon management and improve the digitalization level of 
energy-saving management. Based on big data, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and other technologies, the platform 
reflects real-time energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission information of each energy consumption system, and 
provides intelligent energy efficiency optimization solutions through the functional modules of energy consumption data 
analysis, intelligent carbon emission data accounting, carbon footprint tracking and supervision. In addition, the system can 
generate energy efficiency analysis reports on a regular basis, making data traceable and management evidence-based.

Case: Zero-Carbon Management Platform for Data Center Park

VNET takes the Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) as the digital base and takes ""green, low-carbon, economically 
feasible, digital-wise, safe and reliable"" as the basic principle to build the Zero-Carbon Management Platform for Data 
Center Park (hereinafter referred to as ""the Platform""). The Platform helps the parks achieve green, low-carbon and digital 
development through four major functions.

•  Carbon Monitoring: The Platform achieves the comprehensive view of the park carbon source monitoring, and real-time 

monitoring of unnormal state of energy consumption, carbon emissions and helps the data center park realize the unified 
dispatching and management of energy and carbon emissions in real time.

•  Carbon Analysis: Through the three-dimensional analysis of energy consumption and carbon emissions data, the Platform 
implements the park carbon emissions measurement model. In addition, the Platform can also compare and analyze the 
carbon reduction actions with substandard effects, and gain insight into the root causes of energy consumption and carbon 
emission alarms.

•  Carbon Optimization: The Platform achieves the collaborative application of carbon reduction measures, such as low carbon 
energy supply management, energy conservation and management of equipment, etc. At the same time, it can assist in the 
analysis of carbon reduction effect and predict the annual total carbon emission curve.

•  Carbon Action: The Platform establishes the refined management mode of the whole process, which can realize the progress 

tracking of carbon targets and dynamic evaluation of implementation effects, and can establish the evaluation standard 
system of zero carbon parks and green buildings, and propose optimization measures.

It can adequately use natural cooling to replace 

mechanical cooling and extend the duration of 

natural cooling to reduce air conditioning energy 

consumption. Compared with conventional water-

cooling systems, the ""Deep Cold"" system can improve 

energy efficiency by about 30% to 50% each year. The 

""Deep Cold"" system performs well in improving water 

utilization and consumes much less water than the 

conventional cooling systems with cooling towers. 

Empowering Energy Transition 
VNET actively responds to the country's goal of accelerating the construction of a new power system based on new energy. 

We explore the fields of renewable energy, energy storage technologies and energy Internet, leading the energy transition of 

the industry.

application of large-scale wind power and PV power in data centers. We actively apply clean energy on a pilot basis in 

existing data centers, cooperate with the power grid to develop green dedicated lines and conduct research on hydrogen 

energy as well as continuously increase the proportion of clean energy in data center energy consumption. 

In addition, we have developed a Green Power Management Platform to promote the transition and upgrading of the energy 

structure by intelligent means. The platform is a comprehensive solution for green power applications that integrates 

data integration, intelligent analysis, and collaborative management. It helps data centers refine energy management by 

incorporating green energy from surrounding areas and industry parks into the management scope, performing centralized 

management and optimizing power dispatch management and power distribution. 

Distributed renewable energy 

In 2022, VNET constantly explored and applied distributed renewable energy, using solar energy to provide clean energy for 

data centers. 

Case: Exploring ""Building + PV"" integration

Contributing to Sustainability: Towards a Zero-carbon FutureHydrogen energy research 

In 2022, VNET strengthened its research on hydrogen energy in the field of data centers and promoted the research 

on hydrogen production, storage, transmission and other module technologies. We also compiled the White Paper on 

Hydrogen Energy Development in Data Centers and carried out feasibility studies on the application of hydrogen energy 

in IDCs to promote the development and application of hydrogen energy technologies. We have actively cooperated with 

external professional institutions, and planned the patent layout in various related fields such as hydrogen source, hydrogen 

conversion to electricity and hydrogen energy grid connection. 

In April 2022, we signed the strategic cooperation framework agreement with Jinghui Hydrogen Energy in Beijing. Based 

on our respective resources and professional capabilities, the two parties will jointly explore the in-depth integration of 

technologies such as hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing, diversified hydrogen production, green power and 

hydrogen storage with data centers. 

In September 2022, VNET launched a hydrogen energy pilot test and pre-research project research to explore the first 

domestic stationary hydrogen fuel cell as a common power source for long-term power supply solutions for data centers. 

With data centers as main load objects, the project is equipped with a 100 kW hydrogen fuel cell module, which can provide 

a 24-hour uninterrupted power supply for data centers and reduce carbon emissions by about 1.4 tons per day, exploring 

the new technical route for the establishment of future zero-carbon data centers. 

Green power trading

(approximately 4 million kWh) with CGN Solar Energy (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd, which contains a green power supply guarantee 

clause of about 500 million kWh in the next five years.

Green electricity certificate

In 2022, VNET purchased 500,000 kWh of green electricity 

produced by Xi 'an Longji photovoltaic power generation 

grid parity project in Xinrong, Shanxi Province, and 

500,000 kWh of green electricity produced by 90,000-kW 

photovoltaic power plant of Datang Shanxi photovoltaic 

power generation project in Lingchuan, Shanxi Province, 

which are equivalent to reducing 826,900kg of carbon 

dioxide emission, 470kg of sulfur dioxide emission and 

430kg of nitrogen oxide emission in total.

Energy storage technologies

New energy storage technologies are the basic equipment for constructing new power systems. The movement towards 

load-storage integrated data centers which are equipped with supporting energy storage facilities provides a new pathway 

to the transition to green energy, and helps us to achieve the economic balance between green power supply and green 

computing power. VNET actively promotes innovative forms of load-storage integrated data centers as well as continuously 

exploring new scenarios for integrating clean energy and energy storage. 

In 2022, VNET shared its advanced experience, enhancing the high-quality development path within the new energy 

storage industry. We carried out research on long-time energy storage technologies and relevant investment costs such 

as photovoltaic and chemical batteries, and prepared the white paper on energy storage technologies to promote the 

industrial development of energy storage technologies. In addition, we teamed up with several institutions, including 

the Energy Internet Research Institute of Tsinghua University, to launch the global collaborative innovation initiative – 

""New Energy Storage – SPEAR 2030"". Following the upgrade and implementation guidelines within the original SPEAR 

demonstration project, the initiative intends to achieve the goal of 100 GWh of new energy storage by 2030 through two 

practical approaches known as ""node project + technological innovation"", and thereby establishes an enterprise-based, 

market-oriented green energy storage innovation paradigm integrating the efforts of enterprises, universities and research 

institutions. 

Up to now, VNET has implemented a series of demonstration projects including the Foshan Smart City Data Center and has 

analyzed and calculated the economic benefits of these projects. In the future, we will actively promote multiple energy 

storage application projects in Beijing, Ulanqab and Hangzhou. 

Case: ""Photovoltaic + energy storage"" technology in Foshan data center

VNET Foshan Smart City Data Center is the first project in China to apply new energy storage technologies on a large scale to 
a data center. Balancing efficiency and safety, the project adopts the mode of ""peak load shifting"" to effectively enhance the 
renewable energy consumption capacity of the power system. In addition, the Data Center also improved its clean energy self-
sufficiency rate through distributed PV power supply. As a result, the annual carbon emission reduction reached about 75 tons. 
The project was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Award in the selection of ""Innovation Pioneer"" Low-carbon Computing 
Power Pioneer Cases at the 2022 China Computing Conference for its role in low-carbon innovation demonstration, and was 
selected as an excellent case in the New Wave of Green Power Consumption in Technology Enterprises: Cases, Challenges and 
Recommendations jointly released by Greenpeace and Sichuan Energy Internet Research Institute, Tsinghua University.

Climate-related Financial Disclosure 

Climate change brings realistic, severe and long-term challenges to mankind. 

At present, the international community has further realized the severity and 

urgency of the climate crisis. The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United 

Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in 2022 focused on 

""implementation"" and emphasized that all parties should effectively put the 

proposed goals into actions and cooperate to address the urgent climate change 

challenges. 

As a TCFD support organization, VNET has incorporated climate change into 

our corporate strategic considerations and regularly conducts comprehensive 

assessments of the risks and opportunities associated with all assets and 

business based on the extent of potential financial impact, the impact on 

stability of business activities, customer and shareholder concerns and other

Frequency and severity of 
extreme weather events 

Heat dissipation efficiency is crucial to the stable operation of a data center. Hot 
weather will impose higher requirements on the heat dissipation performance 
of servers and other electronic equipment. Moreover, hot weather may affect the 
normal work of employees. 

Since the cooling of data center equipment requires a large amount of water, some areas 
with high stress on water resources may face the risk of water shortage.

In the long run, rising sea levels may affect the layout of data centers operating in 
coastal areas and force their relocation to inland regions. 

An increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events may cause 
damage to data centers, office buildings and equipment, resulting in operational 
interruption and accelerated equipment depreciation. Service interruptions or major 
damage to equipment may also directly or indirectly affect customers' business 
continuity and economic interests. In addition, severe extreme weather events may 
also pose threats to the lives of employees.

China's national and local governments may launch more stringent climate 
policies (such as implementing a carbon price mechanism and urge the use of 
renewable energy), which will therefore have impact on the management of 
energy use and carbon emissions at VNET's data centers.

The emergence of new technologies (such as renewable energy, energy storage, 
and energy efficiency) will require VNET to keep abreast of the development of the 
latest technologies to improve our energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. 

Shifts in customer preferences may increase the focus on low-carbon data centers 
and renewable energy and such shifts may produce an impact on the marketing of 
our core business. 

Shareholders, customers, news media and other stakeholders are highly interested 
in VNET's efforts to reduce energy and carbon emissions and address climate 
change. Therefore, we need to take positive actions to meet the expectations of 
the stakeholders under this issue.

At the company level, worldwide 
extreme weather events caused by 
climate change, such as extreme 
rainfall, typhoons, and floods, may 
threaten the physical security, 
stable power supply, and short-term 
electricity cost of our data centers and 
the IT infrastructure of our customers. 
Moreover, the growing frequency and 
intensity of regional extreme weather 
events further increases the possibility 
and impact of acute risks.

Chronic physical risk-
High temperature 

On the one hand, hot weather may 
shorten the working hours of the 
Group's employees in the open air 
and place higher requirements for 
heatstroke prevention and cooling. 

On the other hand, hot weather may 
increase the difficulty in cooling 
equipment at data centers. An 
increase in temperature may raise 
the possibility of fires, potentially 
exposing us to the risk of operational 
interruption or asset loss.

Short-term 

Mid-term 

Long-term 

To mitigate the impact of such risk, we 
consider the risk exposures of extreme 
weather events at different stages of 
the asset life cycle. We first manage 
potential risks through scientific site 
selection and design standards for 
data centers, and then take preventive 
measures to reduce losses associated 
with acute weather events. We 
evaluate and check the effectiveness 
of these measures annually and 
ensure that effective management 
measures are in place for climate 
change risk factors in each data center. 
Meanwhile, VNET receives reports 
from insurance service providers, and 
purchases insurance for each item of 
asset accordingly.

We are always concerned about the 
occupational health and safety of our 
employees and provide a series of 
protective measures and subsidies for 
outdoor operations of employees in 
hot weather. 

We apply greater prudence in the 
planning and siting phase, considering 
the potential physical risks of building 
data centers in areas with prolonged 
hot weather to avoid relevant risks 
or to take early countermeasures. 
We optimize cooling systems during 
the design phase and continuously 
improve cooling efficiency through 
various technology upgrades during 
the operational phase. 

We identify and assess the water 
resources stress where our data centers 
are located, and consider it in data 
center planning and siting. Meanwhile, 
we actively develop water-free cooling 
technologies, take various measures 
to improve water use efficiency and 
continuously reduce dependence on 
water resources. 

We consider the potential physical 
risks of building data centers in coastal 
areas and constantly optimize the 
layout of data centers. 

To reduce this risk, we strengthen 
energy management and control 
as well as gradually raising the 
proportion of clean energy. We have 
a dedicated team that regularly 
studies national policies and proposes 
countermeasures to ensure our 
operational compliance.

To mitigate such risks, our design 
team adheres to high standards when 
building data centers to reduce the 
impact of any data center construction 
codes on data center operations and 
development. 

For more information about the risk-
mitigating measures we adopt in data 
center construction, see Planning and 
Design, and Project Construction. 

To reduce such risks, we actively 
explore the possibility of achieving 
technological advances in energy 
storage technology, hydrogen 
energy research, development and 
application of DCIM platforms, and 
strengthen the construction of a 
green, low-carbon and intelligent IT 
infrastructure in the future. 

To control such risks, we actively 
track customer needs through 
communication and feedback 
mechanisms. We are also committed 
to making key progress in renewable 
energy and low-carbon targets (emission 
reduction targets) and advancing the 
construction of low-carbon/zero-carbon 
data centers. 

To mitigate such risks, we seek 
suppliers that are less exposed 
to climate change, such as those 
using alternative energy sources or 
evaluating the use of alternative raw 
materials. For our energy suppliers, 
we explore price advantages by means 
of cooperation or agreements. In the 
meantime, we have signed power 
purchase agreements with renewable 
energy suppliers progressively to 
secure energy supply and stabilize 
prices. 

To address such risks, VNET performs 
comprehensive management on 
all ESG risks through the SHIELD 
system. It also establishes an effective 
governance structure to regularly 
assess the impact of climate change-
related issues on the Group's 
reputation, and continuously improve 
the transparency of our sustainability 
disclosures. 

The low-carbon development of data centers will be an important driving force to promote the sustainable development of 

the Group in the future. We hope to seize the historic opportunity of the energy revolution and market shift in the process 

of the industrial and national transition to a low-carbon economy, providing a new green infrastructure solution to address 

climate risks on the global level. 

Renewable energy 

Transitioning to low- and zero-emission energy sources and investing in new renewable energy 

solutions will potentially lower our operating expenses in the long run and reduce the exposure 

of data centers to possible risks in carbon-related regulations, fees or taxes. Additionally, we 

have the opportunity to increase our revenue by developing renewable products and solutions

Nurturing talent 
VNET places great emphasis on employee development. We have formulated the Employee Training Management System 

and established a multi-level and systematized employee training system. We ensure that our employees are trained 

according to their development stages and all kinds of talents can gain support for their career development. We have 

built the VNET E-Learning platform to cultivate talents for each business line via digital means and achieve knowledge co-

creation and sharing. The platform focuses on nurturing leadership skills, professional skills and general skills as well as 

delivering resource integration to tailor learning maps for each employee. Currently, a total of 576 premium courses have

Case: The 6th session of Honor O&M Expert Program

To celebrate the annual O&M Day, VNET launched the sixth session of Honor 

O&M Expert Program on July 22, 2022. This session lasted for nearly two months 

and attracted more than 1,600 participants. We set up four modules: daily 

training, individual competition, team competition and premium operation 

and maintenance training camp. The professional knowledge, practical skills, 

management knowledge, corporate culture and strategic thinking of the 

contestants were examined with multi-dimensional questions. This purpose 

was to select outstanding individuals and teams who were provided with 

bonuses and learning opportunities for exchanges and visits. The program has 

provided our diligent front-line O&M engineers with comprehensive learning 

and growth opportunities and the stage to demonstrate their value. In addition, 

the event has also injected a strong impetus to boost VNET's competitive 

advantage and high-quality development.

For the cultivation of managerial talent, we carried out the young talent training program to systematically empower the talents 

by stages according to the nature of leadership development. VNET Blue Cloud provides core talent with opportunities for mutual 

learning and cross-disciplinary exchange by launching the leadership development program ""Elite Plan"". 

Case: VNET Blue Cloud Internal Trainer Cultivation Program

To maximize the value of the rich professional knowledge and management experience of business backbones 

and management cadres in the targeted training of new recruits, VNET Blue Cloud has launched an internal trainer 

cultivation program to cultivate excellent management cadres into internal trainers, and the internal trainers gradually 

pass on their experience to the trainees through the Blue Cloud Diamond Lecture Platform. In 2022, we trained the first 

batch of 26 trainers and developed 20 training courses through three sessions. This program enhances the sense of 

belonging of new recruits while helping them to grow, and also enables internal trainers to improve their own abilities 

in the process of teaching. 

VNET applies the formal talent pipeline development strategy to actively develop new pools of talent that have great 

potential. We carry out diverse training practices and competitions and strengthen school-enterprise cooperation to inject 

fresh blood into the Group's talent pool. In 2022, VNET established a school-enterprise cooperation mechanism known 

as a ""oriented class"" with 1 institution, and reached cooperation agreements with 8 institutions to jointly build internship 

bases and participated in the ""Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative"" organized by the China Association of Higher 

Education. 

Case: VNET Blue Cloud New Generation Training Program

To develop the core strength of future talents, VNET Blue Cloud focuses on the rising generations of post-95s and post-

00s and has set up a special training channel for the new generations. In 2022, three training sessions were organized 

to train a total of 59 talents. In the process of talent development, the Group helped the new generation of employees 

to build a communication and interaction platform, and developed the new talent pool for the management team and 

business backbone team in the future.

In addition, VNET encourages employees to leverage external professional resources to improve their expertise and provides 

support for all employees by reimbursing their expenses for pursuing degrees or professional certifications. Based on different 

business needs, we offer our employees opportunities for external training, professional examinations and certifications. In 2022, 

we arranged a total of 18 external training sessions, invested RMB 350,000 in external certifications and reimbursed employees 

RMB 205,000 for related expenses.

for all employees. In 2022, we formulated and released 

the VNET Position & Rank Management Procedure, 

providing employees with four career development

Employees can choose their paths according to their 

career plans. 

In 2022, we formulated the Employee Assessment and 

Competency Management Procedure for the O&M 

Department and established the planned, standard 

and quantifiable employee assessment management 

mechanism based on the rank system. The performance

Message from CEO

In	2021,	VNET	celebrated	an	important	milestone:	our	25th	anniver-

Mutual growth: Internally	 we	give	top	priority	to	enriching	 talent	

sary	of	foundation	and	10th	anniversary	of	listing.	The	creation	and	

pool	and	enhancing	talent	development,	and	have	done	so	by	active-

development	of	a	company	are	inseparable	from	the	opportunities	

ly	creating	a	diverse	and	inclusive	workplace	that	respects	employ-

endowed	by	our	time.	Amid	profound	changes	unseen	in	a	century,	

ees'	rights	and	interests,	while	enabling	their	development.	External-

we	have	experienced	both	unprecedented	challenges	and	opportu-

ly	we	collaborate	with	our	partners	to	create	a	low-carbon	and	ener-

nities.	On	the	one	hand,	the	COVID-19	outbreak,	worsening	climate	

gy-efficient	supply	chain,	achieve	green	development,	and	promote	

change	and	sluggish	economic	recovery	have	collectively	put	our	

industry	innovation	and	change.	Additionally,	we	honor	our	social	

world	in	one	of	the	most	difficult	situations	in	decades.	On	the	oth-

responsibility	with	concrete	actions	by	proposing	the	joint	action	se-

er	hand,	digital	advancement	and	adaptation	accelerated	by	these	

ries	of	""Digital	Rural	Revitalization	–	Reshaping	Top	100	Brands""	and	

challenges	 have	paved	 the	 way	to	 new	infrastructure	and	a	more	

establishing	a	talent	training	alliance	featuring	""Intelligent	Operation	

digitalized	future	closer	to	us	than	ever.	We	are	seeing	technologies	

and	Maintenance"",	contributing	to	cultivating	outstanding	talents	for	

such	as	cloud	services,	5G,	and	artificial	intelligence	(AI)	driving	the	

our	industry.

Looking	back	on	2021,	we	actively	expanded	our	""circle	of	friends""	

for	sustainability.	We	joined	the	UN	Global	Compact,	voiced	support	

for	TCFD,	and	created	VNET's	own	sustainability	management	sys-

tem	""SHIELD""	(Social,	Human,	Innovation,	Environment,	Leadership	

and	Development)	to	measure	and	manage	our	progress	in	relevant	

aspects.

As	a	domestic	leader	and	a	global	key	player,	VNET	seeks	to	contrib-

ute	to	a	greener,	more	prosperous	and	harmonious	future	with	our	

partner.	We	strive	to	do	so	by	leveraging	our	industrial	resources,

development	of	industrial	clusters,	and	the	physical-digital	integra-

tion	generating	huge	demand	for	data	storage	and	computing	capac-

ity.	Having	thrived	for	more	than	two	decades,	VNET	is	well	seasoned	

in	weathering	both	opportunities	and	challenges	posed	to	us	by	the	

world	around	us.	This	time	more	specifically,	we	see	the	possibili-

ties	of	reshaping	the	business	philosophy	for	our	company	and	the	

industry.

We	believe	in	long-term	commitments	and	responsibilities	for	our	

industry,	environment,	and	society,	as	they	are	the	foundation	of	our	

ongoing	success	in	a	highly	competitive,	ever-changing	market.	To	

this	end,	we	always	adhere	to	the	national	strategy,	contribute	to	the	

economic	and	social	development,	and	proactively	improve	our	ESG	

management	and	performances:

Towards zero carbon: VNET	has	developed	the	""4C""	strategy	for	our	

2030	carbon	neutrality	commitment	and	continued	to	make	progress	

toward	this	target	by	the	following	initiatives:	explore	and	expand	op-

portunities	for	new	energy	applications	and	increase	their	utilization	

in	total	energy	consumption;	commit	to	building	green	data	centers	

and	promoting	green	operations	throughout	business	phases	includ-

ing	planning	and	design,	construction,	and	operation	management;	

extend	full	support	to	global	climate	actions,	gradually	reduced	the	

impact	of	business	operations	on	the	environment,	and	contributing	

to	the	battle	against	climate	change.

Digital empowerment: Over	the	past	25	years,	VNET	has	made	unre-

mitting	efforts	to	underpin	core	foundation	of	digital	infrastructure.	

Based	on	the	""wholesale	 +	new	retail""	 dual-core	 strategy	and	the	

SPEAR	plan,	we	have	accelerated	the	construction	of	the	next-gener-

ation	intelligent	information	infrastructure.	Relying	on	new	features	

such	as	new-generation	data	center	services,	the	Blue	Cloud	Digital	

Asset	Management	Platform,	Cloud	Native	and	cloud-network	inte-

gration,	we	continue	to	play	a	key	role	in	the	Nation's	""Digital	China""	

blueprint,	and	contribute	to	the	new-generation	digital	economy	

across	the	globe.

To achieve net zero set out in the Paris Agreement, China announced the goals of ""striving to peak carbon diox-

ide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060"" in September 2020. In line with China's 

""dual carbon"" goals and the Group strategy of sustainability, VNET has taken the initiative to make the applica-

tion of clean technologies one of its core strategies and develop carbon neutrality strategies. We also support 

our customers and partners with cloud services to reduce energy consumption in IT infrastructure, to jointly 

build a zero-carbon society. 

Commitments to Carbon Neutrality

Our Targets

Faced	with	the	global	challenges	of	climate	change,	VNET,	as	a	lead-

ing	and	responsible	IT	infrastructure	service	provider,	has	set	ambi-

tious	carbon	reduction	targets.	These	are	based	on	the	results	of	car-

bon	emission	inventory	and	third-party	verification	in	combination	

with	our	past	carbon	reduction	practices,	in	an	attempt	to	drive	the	

Group's	low-carbon	transition.	Our	carbon	reduction	commitments	

are	as	follows:

Our Strategies

VNET Carbon Neutrality Targets

By	2030

Achieving	operational	carbon neutrality	

in	Scope	1	and	Scope	2	emissions

Achieving	100%	renewable	energy	use	in	operations

Based	on	our	current	carbon	emission	status	and	business	model,	we	have	developed	a	""4C""	pathway	towards	carbon	neutrality,	namely,	carbon	

avoidance,	carbon	reduction,	carbon	offset,	and	carbon	empowerment.	This	will	fully	leverage	an	array	of	approaches	including	renewable	ener-

gy	transition,	energy-saving	technology	use,	carbon	sinks,	carbon	trading	and	empowerment	of	the	upstream	and	downstream	industrial	chain.

Carbon Avoidance

Carbon Reduction

	● 	Achieve	100%	renewable	energy	use	by	2030	
through	direct	purchase	of	green	power,	pur-
chase	of	renewable	energy	certificates	(RECs),	
and	investment	in	clean	energy	sources.

	● 	Uphold	green	building	standards	in	data	centers	
while	continuously	improving	energy	efficien-
cy	and	reducing	PUE	and	carbon	emissions	
through	waste	heat	recovery	and	application	of	
new	cooling	technologies.

Achieve carbon 
neutrality 
by 2030

Carbon Offset

Carbon Empowerment

	● 	Make	investment	in	high-quality	carbon	offset	
projects	to	offset	carbon	emissions	that	are	dif-
ficult	to	be	avoided	or	removed.

	● 	Promote	carbon	reduction	actions	across	the	
supply	chain	through	adopting	a	green	and	
low-carbon	procurement	model	and	regularly	
disclosing	the	Group's	carbon	neutrality	progress,	
thus	becoming	an	industry	leader	in	green	devel-
opment	and	achieving	""dual	carbon""	goals.

Based	on	the	current	renewable	energy	policies,	analysis	of	market	and	technology	trends,	as	well	as	an	in-depth	feasibility	study	of	on-site	re-

source	access	methods,	VNET	has	formulated	the	following	short-term	and	long-term	directions	of	action	and	pathways,	with	a	view	to	gradually	

develop	feasible	targets	for	stages.

Climate Action: Towards a Zero-carbon FutureOur Actions

As	shown	by	VNET's	statistical	records	and	carbon	emission	inventory	results,	the	majority	of	carbon	emissions	from	our	operations	come	from	

electricity	use.	Therefore,	the	transition	to	renewable	energy	is	an	essential	pathway	to	reducing	greenhouse	gas	emissions	and	mitigating	cli-

mate	change.

Multi-dimensional renewable energy practices

Green Practice through-
out Operation Cycle

In	 order	 to	 fulfill	 our	 commitments	 to	 carbon	

neutrality	and	contribute	to	China's	""dual	carbon""	

goals,	 VNET	 is	 actively	 following	 a	 green	 devel-

opment	path	that	is	""high-efficient,	low-carbon,	

intensive	and	circular"",	with	the	focus	on	improv-

ing	 the	 energy	 utilization	 rate	 throughout	 the	

life	cycle	of	design,	construction,	operation	and	

maintenance	of	data	centers.	We	deeply	explore	

the	potential	of	energy	conservation	and	emission	

reduction	in	our	daily	operation,	in	line	with	the	

strategic	 planning	 of	 green	 development	 at	 the	

industrial	and	national	level.	In	2021,	the	average	

PUE	of	our	stabilized	data	centers	was	1.37.

Green buildings

In	the	designing	period	of	data	centers,	we	benchmark	with	the	in-

ternational	design	standard	of	Tier	III	Ready	and	strive	for	the	maxi-

mum	greenness	while	ensuring	the	computational	power	of	our	data	

centers.	All	new	data	centers	are	designed	in	accordance	with	the	

one-star	green	building	standard.	For	architectural	design,	we	adopt	

more	energy-saving	and	environment-friendly	building	structures	

or	designs.	For	the	selection	of	building	materials,	we	give	priority	

to	materials	that	are	durable,	environment	friendly	and	recyclable.	

In	addition,	we	plan	to	apply	for	green	building	certification	such	as	

LEED	or	GREEN	BUILDING	for	all	newly-planned	data	centers.

High-efficiency equipment

The	energy	consumption	of	data	centers	mainly	comes	from	IT	

equipment,	cooling	system,	and	power	supply	and	distribution	sys-

tem.	Therefore,	we	have	applied	a	range	of	green	equipment	or	tech-

Privacy and Data Security Protection

VNET	has	utilized	world-leading	encryption	methods,	protocols,	and	

algorithms	to	ensure	that	customer	data	is	securely	transmitted	and	

confidentially	stored	within	our	infrastructure.	We	have	applied	a	

variety	of	security	protection	technologies	and	methods	to	fully	se-

cure	the	customer	cloud	computing	environment.	While	discussing	

technology	types	with	our	customers	in	the	early	phase	of	a	project,	

we	delved	into	their	requirements	on	information	security	to	cus-

tomize	cloud	platform	solutions.	This	includes,	but	is	not	limited	to,	

the	selection	of	cloud	platforms	and	security	components	as	well	as	

suggestions	on	security	strategies	and	network	isolation.

In	addition,	VNET	formulated	the	Regulations	on	Access	Management	

Systems,	the	Office	Network	Security	Access	Management	Regula-

tions,	the	Remote	Access	Permission	Management	Regulations	and	

other	regulations	to	standardize	security	operations	by	employees	in	

different	working	environments.

Fostering Culture

VNET	is	fully	aware	that	the	implementation	of	information	security	

management	does	not	only	depend	on	the	continuous	improvement	

of	systems,	mechanisms,	and	technologies	but	also	relies	on	the	full	

engagement	of	employees.	We	highly	value	fostering	an	information	

security	culture	and	awareness	among	our	employees	and	offering

to	prepare	them	for	different	risks	in	different	positions	that	they	may	

face.	In	2021,	100%	of	our	employees	received	training	on	informa-

tion	security.

Formulating Industry Standard

we	will	immediately	take	serious	actions	against	those	responsible

Closed-loop Procurement Management

Sustainable Supply Chain

VNET	 boasts	 diverse	 business	 partners	 and	 values	 procurement	

VNET	is	committed	to	building	a	sustainable	supply	system,	aiming	

process	management.	In	strict	compliance	with	national	laws	and	

to	safeguard	procurement	needs	and	ensure	obligation	fulfillment	

applicable	industry	guidelines,	we	have	developed	the	Regulations	

while	actively	urging	our	suppliers	to	improve	sustainability.	In	each	

on	Procurement	Management,	the	Regulations	on	Supplier	Manage-

work	process	of	the	supplier	management,	we	incorporate	consider-

ment,	and	the	Code	of	Conduct	for	Procurement	Personnel	for	re-

ations	on	their	ESG	risks	and	focus	on	their	performance	in	environ-

sponsible	procurement,	which	committed	to	establishing	to	mutually	

mental	protection	and	low	carbon,	information	security,	labor	rights	

beneficial	cooperation	with	suppliers	for	the	long	term.	As	of	the	end	

and	interests,	occupational	health	and	safety,	as	well	as	honesty	and	

of	the	reporting	period,	we	had	2,145	suppliers,	including	3	in	Hong	

integrity.

Kong,	Macao,	and	Taiwan	and	3	outside	of	the	Chinese	mainland,	

Hong	Kong,	Macao,	and	Taiwan.

We	 identify,	 prevent,	 and	 control	 potential	 risks	 in	 all	 aspects	 of	

procurement.	We	assess	suppliers	in	terms	of	their	financial	risks,	

business	ethics,	EHS	management,	quality	management,	and	etc.	

throughout	our	review	process	from	multiple	perspectives.	This	in-

volves	shortlisting,	on-site	inspection,	internal	evaluation	and	test,	

public	announcement	of	the	shortlisting,	and	selection.

We	regularly	review	existing	suppliers	to	screen	out	premium	can-

didates	based	on	service	awareness,	product	quality	and	capability	

to	fulfill	obligations.	Substandard	suppliers	are	required	to	conduct	

rectification	and	would	be	eliminated	if	the	rectifications	proved	to	

be	below	our	standards.

	● 	Environmental	protection	and	low	carbon:	We	prefer	suppliers	with	

ISO	14001	and	sound	carbon	management

	● 	Information	security:	We	sign	the	contracts	and	the	Supplier	Confi-
dentiality	Agreement	with	suppliers	who	have	confirmed	the	part-
nership	with	us	to	clarify	information	security	responsibilities	and	
confidentiality	obligations

	● 	Labor	rights	and	interests:	We	strictly	prohibit	suppliers	from	

employing	child	labor	and	forced	labor,	and	actively	protect	and	
promote	the	legitimate	rights	and	interests	of	employees	across	the	
supply	chain

	● 	Occupational	health	and	safety:	Suppliers	are	required	to	comply	
with	applicable	safety	regulations,	establish	a	sound	occupational	
health	protection	system,	and	provide	health	and	safety	training	to	
their	staff	when	appropriate

	● 	Honesty	and	integrity:	We	conduct	anti-corruption	training	for	

procurement	personnel.	We	also	require	all	suppliers	to	sign	the	
Anti-bribery	Commitment	Letter	and	synchronize	the	information	
of	dishonest	suppliers	to	the	database	of	the	China	Enterprise	An-
ti-Fraud	Alliance

Honoring Corporate Responsibility: Mutual GrowthResponsible Corporate Citizen

VNET	 actively	 fulfills	 social	 responsibilities	 as	 a	 corporate	 citizen	

and	leverages	our	industrial	strengths	so	that	local	communities	can	

benefit	from	our	operations.	In	2021,	we	carried	out	various	public	

welfare	projects	pertaining	to	education,	rural	revitalization,	and	eco-

logical	protection.

Cultivating Smart Operation and Maintenance Talent

In	contribution	to	the	""New	Engineering""	education	strategy,	VNET	

launched	the	 ""Smart	 Operation	 and	Maintenance""	talent	 training	

Alliance	 with	 China	 Academy	 of	 Information	 and	 Communication	

Technology	 (CAICT).	 We	 also	 launched	 the	 first	 Employment	 and	

Education	Forum	for	Universities	in	China	and	the	cooperative	eco-

system	of	""Join	Actions	on	Employment	and	Education"".	We	aim	to	

partner	up	with	more	educational	institutions,	including	universities	

and	vocational	colleges,	in	their	plans	of	creative	entrepreneurship	

development	to	empower	graduate	traineeship	programs	and	joint	

training	programs	for	the	staff	that	drive	the	further	implementation	

of	industry-education	integration.

Serving Digital Rural Revitalization

In	response	to	the	national	strategy	of	rural	revitalization,	VNET	led	

the	interconnected	and	innovative	community	of	the	digital	economy	

in	advocating	the	""Digital	Rural	Revitalization	-	Reshaping	Top	100	

Brands""	series	of	joint	actions	to	promote	the	non-profit	cause	of	

serving	the	rural	revitalization	strategy.	As	part	of	these	actions,	we	

included	the	Wuyi	Mountains	and	Wuyi	Tea	in	our	pilot	project	to	ex-

plore	the	coordinated	model	of	""Tea	Culture	+Tea	Technology	+	Tea	

Industry""	and	best	practice	of	digital	economic	development	for	rural

The meeting of the joint action

Empowering Green Ecological Construction

To	respond	to	the	national	call	of	ecological	civilization	construction,	

VNET	organized	a	tree-planting	event	named	Guarding	""Clear	Wa-

ters	and	Green	Mountains	for	Ecological	Interconnectivity""	in	2021.	

During	 the	 event,	 our	 community	 of	 employees	 spent	 244	 hours	

planting	 125	 cypress	 trees.	 This	 made	 a	 positive	 contribution	 to	

greening	up	the	mountain	landscape	and	protecting	the	ecological	

environment.

Caring for the Health of Mountain-area Girls

At	the	beginning	of	2022,	VNET	organized	a	charity	sale	themed	""Em-

power	Her	for	Mutual	Growth"",	where	second-hand	items	were	sold	

and	then	the	funds	raised	were	partly	used	to	buy	feminine	hygiene	

products	for	more	than	3,000	female	students	in	the	mountainous	

areas	of	Dahua	County,	Guangxi.	We	hope	that	this	type	of	event	will	

help	young	women	in	less	economically	developed	areas	to	over-

come	hygiene	problems	and	inspire	more	companies	to	carry	out	

similar	efforts.

Introduction and objectives of work   
BUREAU VERITAS CERTIFICATION (BEIJING) CO. LTD (""Bureau Veritas"") has been engaged by VNET Group

management of VNET Group. Bureau Veritas was not involved in the drafting of the Report. Our sole responsibility 

was to provide independent assurance on the accuracy and reliability of information included, and on the underlying 

systems and processes used to collect, analysis and review it. 

Scope of work 
VNET Group requested Bureau Veritas to verify the accuracy and reliability of the following:

  Positional  statements  (expressions  of  opinion,  belief,  aim  or  future  intention  by  VNET  Group)  and 

statements of future commitment;

  Review of VNET Group systems for data and information collection, aggregation, analysis and review. 

The work was conducted against Bureau Veritas’ standard procedures and guidelines for external assurance of 

ESG  reports,  based  on  current  best  practice  in  independent  assurance.    In  the  assurance    process,  we  have 

used ISAE3000 (Revised), the AA1000 and the GRI    standards.
